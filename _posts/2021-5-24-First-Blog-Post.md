What do you think being a data scientist is about? 
I believe being a data scientist is about having enough domain knowledge to know what question to formulate or how to collect data to address the question being asked. Then having the statistical and programming knowledge to know how to collect or retrive data, how to ingest and transform this data, how to analyze the data and eventually how to present the outcomes to others. Essentially data scientists need to be able to use data to predict future outcomes or help the higher ups make key decisions that are supported by data.  

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
To be a data scientist, one should have sufficient knowledge in statistics, programming, and domain knowledge. It is expected that a data scientist can collect/retrive data, ingest data, transform data, do statistical analysis, and present the findings. Proficency in statistics and programming is a must, and a data scientist should know what questions to investigate or what route to take when dealing with a question, this is why having domain knowledge is important. 

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
I believe statisticians definitely has more statistical knowledge and/or deeper understanding of statistical research, whereas data scientists would have a deeper understanding of computer science. Other differences between the two include size of data they each study or utilize, what types of problems are being investigated, what model processes are being used, etc. Statisticians and data scientists are similar in that both are trying to utilize data to gain knowledge on a particular subject matter. 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
After I graduate from the Statistics master's program, I'd definitely see myself more as a statistician than a data scientist. Personally I'm not quite certain that I'd have enough programming skills to be a proficient data scientist, but when it comes to domain knowledge it can be gained on the job. Eventually I do hope to become a data scientist, so I plan to take more programming courses upon graduating from the Statistics program.
