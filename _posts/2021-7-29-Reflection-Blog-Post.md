**What (if anything) has changed about what I think a data scientist is and what they do**\
My impression of what a data scientist is and what they do has not changed through taking this course. I still think that data scientists need sufficient programming skills and domain knowledge to be successful. 

**What my current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - will I continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**\
When I was first introduced to R back in ST501 I was very resistant, but now that I've taken a whole course on R it's growing on me. I actually like the many functionalities of R and the environment and syntax. I've gotten used to doing data manipulation and analysis through R and will definitely continue to use R going forward. I do hope to also take Python and will compare then whether I'm more comfortable using R or Python. For now, R is my go to language for statistics because I've had enough practice through this course and feel confident using it. The support community online to help troubleshoot practically any question or issue I may have is another plus. 

**What things will I do differently in practice now that I've had this course?**\
I will be paying more attention to what type of object I'm using and how to subset them. Prior to taking this course I had no idea whether an object is a vector, matrix, data frame, list etc. Now that we've learned about them I'm more aware of what type of data I'm working with, which makes data manipulation easier. This course taught me to improve the efficiency of my code, especially with vectorized functions. I also appreciate learning about R Markdown and GitHub, I will incorporate both in my future work.
