### About Me

Hi everyone. My name is Lucy Yin, currently I'm taking my 6th class in the online Statistics master's program at NC State. 

Right now I don't really have time for any hobbies, but eventually one day I'd love to do some leisure reading and watch my dog be silly. 

I have one fur baby, she's turning 9 in 5 days.
